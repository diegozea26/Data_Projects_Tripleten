# Saving SuperStore

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked as a data consultant to analyze a retail company’s operations and identify opportunities to improve profitability and reduce financial risk.

Using Tableau, I performed:
- **Profit and loss analysis** to evaluate performance across categories, regions, and customer segments
- **Advertising analysis** to assess the effectiveness of promotional spending
- **Returned items analysis** to understand how returns impact overall profitability

The analysis uncovered key drivers of losses, highlighted unprofitable segments, and provided data-driven recommendations to support strategic decisions aimed at improving financial sustainability.

## Tools used: 
- Tableau

## Key Insights

- **Copiers in the West and East regions are the strongest profit drivers**, while Tables in the West and South generate the largest losses, indicating a significant regional and product-level imbalance in profitability.
- **A small group of products accounts for a disproportionate share of total losses.** Identifying the bottom loss-making products provides an opportunity to reassess pricing, costs, or potential discontinuation to reduce negative margins.
- **Sub-category analysis reveals clear winners and under-performers.** Copiers, Phones, and Accessories consistently deliver high sales and strong profits, whereas Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables show persistent losses and should be prioritized for strategic review.
