# Returned Orders at the SuperStore

## Project Overview

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked as a data consultant to analyze product returns at a retail superstore, following a direct request from the CEO to identify the root causes behind high return volumes.

Using Tableau, I designed interactive dashboards focused on storytelling and actionable insights, with the objective of understanding where, when, and why returns occur. The analysis examined return behavior across product categories, regions, customers, and time to uncover structural patterns driving inefficiencies and profit loss.

The outcome of this project supports data-driven decision-making by highlighting operational, product, and customer-level factors contributing to excessive returns, and by proposing targeted actions to reduce return rates and improve overall performance.

## Tools used: 
- Tableau

## Key Insights

- **Technology products show the highest return rates** across all categories, suggesting potential issues related to product quality, customer expectations, or supplier reliability.
- **Western states concentrate the highest return activity**, indicating possible regional factors such as logistics, delivery processes, or customer behavior influencing returns.
- **A small group of customers drives a disproportionate share of total returns**, pointing to the need for closer monitoring and targeted engagement strategies.
- **Returns exhibit clear seasonal spikes during specific months**, which may be linked to promotional periods, product launches, or operational strain.
- **Sales volume does not correlate with higher return rates**, indicating that returns are driven more by qualitative factors than by transaction volume alone.

## Recommended Actions

- **Review product quality and supplier performance**, particularly within the Technology category, to reduce return rates at the source.
- **Strengthen logistics and delivery processes in Western states** to address regional inefficiencies contributing to high return volumes.
- **Monitor and support high-return customers** through targeted follow-ups, clearer product information, or revised return policies.
- **Prepare operationally for high-return months** by implementing additional quality checks and planning resources ahead of seasonal spikes.
- **Investigate subcategories with inconsistent return behavior** to identify anomalies, data issues, or improvement opportunities.
